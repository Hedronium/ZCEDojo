    ```PHP
    class A {}
    class B extends A {}
    class C extends B,A
    {
        public function foo()
        {
            echo "IRONMAN";
        }
    }

    (new C)->foo();
    ```

    What is wrong with this code?

options:
    - Cannot inherit from Multiple Classes
    - Cannot inherit from A as B already inherits from A
    - Classes can not be empty
    - Empty Classes can not be Extended
    - There is nothing wrong with it. It Runs fine.

correct: 0
