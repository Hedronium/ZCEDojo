    ```PHP
    class A extends B
    {
        public function foo()
        {
            echo "Foo";
            parent::foo();
        }
    }

    class B
    {
        public function foo()
        {
            echo "Bar";
        }
    }

    $a = new A;
    $a->foo();
    ```

    What is wrong with this code? (Choose the most correct Answer)

options:
    - Nothing, it runs fine, it outputs "FooBar"
    - Nothing, it runs fine, it outputs "BarFoo"
    - Nothing, it runs fine, it outputs "Foo"
    - Class A cannot extend class B as A is defined before B.
    - Class A and B both cannot have the foo() method
    - Can't call parent class statically in object context.
