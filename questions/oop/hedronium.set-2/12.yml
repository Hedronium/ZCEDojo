question: |
    ```PHP
    interface A {
        public $foo;
        public function bar();
    }

    class B implements A
    {
        private $foo = "FOOSKA!";
        
        public function bar()
        {
            echo $this->foo;
        }
    }

    new B;
    ```
    What is wrong with this code? (if any)

options:
    - Interfaces cannot have properties.
    - `$foo` in interface `A` is `public` but `$foo` in class `B` is `private`
    - There is nothing wrong.
    - Both the interface and class define the method `bar()`
    - Interfaces are extended not implemented.

correct: 0
