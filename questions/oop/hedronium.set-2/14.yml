    ```PHP
    class A 
    {
        public $foo = 'FOO';
        private $country = 'Malaysia';
        
        public function __get($name)
        {
            return "Thailand";
        }
    }

    $a = new A;
    $country = $a->country;
    $foo = $a->foo;
    ```
    What are the values contained variables in `$country` and `$foo`?

options:
    - "$country = Thailand, $foo = FOO"
    - "$country = Thailand, $foo = Thailand"
    - "$country = Malaysia, $foo = Malaysia"
    - "$country = Malaysia, $foo = FOO"
    - An error will be thrown as the `$coutry` property is private.

correct: 0
