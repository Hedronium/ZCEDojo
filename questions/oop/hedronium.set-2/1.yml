question: |
    Is there an error in this code? If yes, what is it?

    ```PHP
    class A
    {
        public function bar()
        {
            echo "Bar";    
        }
        
        public function baz()
        {
            echo "Baz";    
        }
        
        abstract public function foo();
    }

    class B extends A
    {
        public function baz()
        {
            echo "Pew";
        }
    }
    ```

options:
    - The abstract method must be implemented.
    - Both classes can not have the `baz` method.
    - None of the classes have an constructor.
    - Abstract methods can not be public.

correct: 0
