    ```PHP
    abstract class A
    {
        abstract public function foo();
        
        public function baz()
        {
            echo "Baz";
        }
        
        public function foo()
        {
            echo "foo";
        }
    }
    ```

    What is wrong with this code?

options:
    - Can not declare abstract method and define a method with the same name.
    - Abstract Classes mcan not have function bodies.
    - Abstract classes can not have abstract methods within itself.
    - A class cannot be abstract.
    - There is nothing wrong.
