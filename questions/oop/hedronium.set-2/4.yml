question: |

    ```PHP
    interface A
    {
        public function foo(array $values);
    }

    class B implements A
    {
        public function foo($values)
        {
            echo implode('-', $values);
        }
    }
    ```

    What is wrong with this code?

options:
    - The function declaration and signature in the interface don't match.
    - Both the interface and class cannot have the `foo` method.
    - The `foo` method's body is not defined in the interface.
    - You cannot typehint arrays.
    - There is nothing wrong.
