    ```PHP
    class A {
        private $a_count = 0;
        
        public function __clone()
        {
            ++$this->a_count;
        }
    }

    $a = new A;
    $b = clone $a;

    echo $a==$b ? 'TRUE' : 'FALSE';
    ```
    What is the output?

options:
    - |
        "TRUE"

    - |
        "FALSE"

    - |
        There will be no output.

    - |
        There will be an undefined constant error, as `clone` is not defined.

correct: 0
